This project introduces an AI-powered career counseling chatbot aimed 
at providing students with accessible, personalized career guidance. 
Traditional counseling often lacks scalability and availability, 
limiting student access to reliable career advice. Using LLM API, 
Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML), 
this chatbot engages users in interactive conversations, 
evaluates academic and personal profiles, and suggests 
suitable career paths.
